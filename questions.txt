Q: how does docker work -> 
Docker is an containarizing app which lets us manage containers. It is different from Virtual Machines (type 1). Docker works on a client server architecture and the main client or the master node here is a Docker Daemon ( dockerd ) which is nothing but the server actually processes the requests sent over by the docker client.

Docker client is what we use wehen we access docke from the command line ( docker run  etc.). A docker client communicates with the docker damemon. Docker daemon can talk to bunch of docker client and can be ona seperate machine allby itself.


Docker client deals with various docker objects (i.e docker images,containers).
